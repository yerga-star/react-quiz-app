## Question Component

The **Question** component is responsible for rendering a single quiz question along with its answer choices. Each question is displayed with its available options, and users can select their answers. Here's a closer look at this component:

### Component Overview

The **Question** component receives the following props:

- `question`: The text of the question.
- `allAnswer`: An array of answer objects containing the answer text, ID, and selection status.
- `quizCompleted`: A boolean indicating whether the quiz has been completed.
- `quizId`: The unique ID of the quiz question.
- `onSelected`: A callback function to handle user answer selections.

### Rendering Answer Choices

The component maps over the `allAnswer` prop to render each answer choice as a clickable div element. When an answer is clicked, the `onSelected` callback is triggered to update the user's selected answers. The background color of the selected answer is changed to provide visual feedback.

### Conditional Styling

The background color of each answer choice is conditionally styled based on whether it's selected by the user. When an answer is selected, its background color is changed to a light blue (#D6DBF5) to differentiate it from other options.
